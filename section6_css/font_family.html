    <h1>Banjo-Kazooie: Nuts & Bolts</h1>
    <a href="">platform game </a>
    <hr>
    <p>Banjo-Kazooie: Nuts & Bolts is a 2008 platform game developed by Rare and published by Microsoft Game Studios for
        the Xbox 360. Set eight years after Banjo-Tooie (2000), Nuts & Bolts follows Banjo and Kazooie as they compete
        with the witch Gruntilda for ownership of their home. Although Nuts & Bolts retains the structure of previous
        Banjo-Kazooie games—collecting jigsaw puzzle pieces to progress—,it shifts the focus from exploration to vehicle
        construction. The player designs vehicles, including automobiles, boats, and aeroplanes, and uses them to
        complete challenges across various worlds. In multiplayer modes, players can compete or share their vehicles
        over Xbox Live.</p>
